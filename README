README for Slay::Maker

Slay::Maker is an all-perl make engine.  Rules are expressed in perl code:

   [ qr/(.*).pm/, ':', "$1.pm.in", '=', sub { ... } ],

and the make is implemented in perl.  Having the rules implemented in
perl using constant strings, regular expressions, and subroutines
give you a lot of power and control over the make process.

Makefiles can be fairly simple subclasses of Slay::Maker.
